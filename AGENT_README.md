2. **CallManager**: Handles both inbound and outbound call operations
3. **Background Services**: Monitors system health and manages ongoing operations

### Call Flow

**Inbound Calls:**

1. Vapi receives the call on your configured phone number
2. The call is routed to your assistant
3. LiveKit handles the real-time conversation
4. CallManager tracks the call status

**Outbound Calls:**

1. Agent receives a request to make a call
2. Uses Vapi to initiate the call
3. CallManager tracks the outbound call
4. LiveKit manages the conversation

### Voice Capabilities

- **Speech Recognition**: Deepgram Nova-3 with multilingual support
- **Text-to-Speech**: Deepgram TTS for natural voice output
- **Language Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite for intelligent responses
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Silero VAD for conversation flow
- **Noise Cancellation**: LiveKit BVC for clear audio

## Usage Examples

Once the agent is running, it can:

- Answer incoming phone calls automatically
- Have natural voice conversations
- Make outbound calls when requested
- Provide customer service assistance
- Handle multiple calls simultaneously

## Configuration

The agent can be customized by:

- Modifying the system prompt in `support_assistant.py`

- Adding new capabilities to the `VapiLiveKitAssistant` class
- Configuring call routing and phone number settings

## Troubleshooting
